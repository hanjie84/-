2017年11月北京成人学士学位英语考试真题及答案 Part I (30%) Passage 1 In 2014, older Americans fell 29 million times, leading to 7 million injuries, according to a report published last week. About 2.8 million cases were treated in emergency department, and approximately 800,000 seniors went on to be hospitalized. More than 27,000 falls led to death. (76) And the problem is getting more and more serious. “Older adult falls are increasing and, sadly, often indicate the end of independence,” said Dr. Tom Frieden. The fallsare preventable, Frieden stressed. He said individuals, families and health care providers can take steps to resist the trend. Dr. Wolf-Klein is a medical professor in New York. She said one concern is that seniors who have experienced a fall alone at home don’t tell anyone. When that happens, prevention efforts don’t begin and they’re at risk学位英语包过q136471195 for additional falls that lead to broken bones and brain injuries. “Elderly patients tend not to report falls to their families, or even doctors. A fall is a very frightening thing that you keep quiet about. They think if they mention it, they are afraid that they will move to a nursing home or need assistants to help out in the house,” said Wolf-Klein. It’s also a status issue and may make someone feel that they’re weaker than they really are, she explained. When someone does fall and hurt themselves, they’re often never the same, Wolf-Klein said. “You can develop chronic(慢性的)problems. After a fall, a percentage of the population will never return to walking around. People used to taking the subway, now they’re in a wheelchair, or they may need help going to the bathroom. They become frailer and lose independence,” she said. 1. Which of the following is TRUE? A. In 2014, older adult falls caused 7 million injuries. B. In 2016, Americans fell 29 million times. C.

But Sheridan Community Schools is the first school district in Indiana to be completely solar-powered. The district finished installing solar panels(太阳能板) for all three of its schools in 2016. Some of the panels can turn to fallow the sun across the sky. Sheridan’s solar push is part of a trend. In 2008, fewer than 1,000 schools used solar power. By 2014, there were 3,727 schools with solar panels in the US. This data comes from a report by the Solar Foundation, an organization that promotes the use of solar power Roxie Brown, a program director there, says that the number of schools with solar panels has continued to rise since 2014. (77) Solar power has some obvious advantage over other energy sources. Sunlight is a renewable(可再生的) resource, which means it won’t run out. Solar panels don’t harm the environment. Also sunlight is free. So by using solar power, schools can save money on energy costs over time. But switching to solar power isn’t always easy Solar panels can be expensive to install. Sheridan Community Schools had to borrow money to pay for its solar transition. (78)The panels also take up space. But for many schools, going solar is worth is. The use of solar energy can also help students learn about electricity and environmental issues. Teacher at schools that use solar power often incorporate it into their science lessons. The kids talk about it in the classroom. Then they can look at it in action. According to Brown, the educational impact of solar panels it “the most compelling reason” for schools to install them. Brown hopes the panels will give Sheridan students a global perspective. “The world is bigger than the boundaries of their school district,” he says. “They’re doing things to help the world as a whole.” 6.

AGi0bal Perspective   Passage 3 Marley Dias loves nothing more than getting lost in a book. But the books she was starting at school were starting to get on her nerves. She enjoyed Where the Red Fem Grows and The Shiloh series, found in so many primary school classrooms, were all about white buys or dogs-or white boys and their dogs. Black girls, like Marley, were almost never the main character. What she was noticing is actually a much bigger issue: fewer than 10 percent of children’s books released in 2015 had a black person as the main character, according to a yearly analysis by the Cooperative Children’s Book Center. In November 2015, Marley set out to gather 1,000 books with black girls as protagonists(主角). Her campaign called”#1000BlackGirlBooks”was a big success. (79) She far exceeded her goal and collected more than 10,000 books!” Through my campaign, I want to give kids a stronger sense of identity.” Marley says. (80) ”The biggest thing I’ve learned is that kid’s voices need to be heard.” In the future, Dias wants to be the editor(编辑) of her own magazine. She is already making the steps toward having a successful and meaningful career At 11, she’s aware of the racism in the publishing industry. Like the television and movies, the publishing industry does not represent black girls or other people of color in positive ways. The whitewashing(漂白) in this industry extend beyond not having people of color as characters. In 2012, white men wrote 88% of the book reviews. In 2013, only about 2% of the books were about black characters. Then if there are people of color in the books, the publishers attempt to whitewash people of color on the covers. However, Dias is making it a little easier for other black girls searching for a character that is just like them. Her project is a positive step toward young black girls seeing and experiencing their lives in books. 11. Which of the following is the best title for the passage? A.
